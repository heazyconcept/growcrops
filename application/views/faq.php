                                   We have a network of experienced farm managers and peasant farmers working with extension workers to
                                   deliver a dedicated farming experience to any one who farms here. Each farm will benefit from about
                                   10 years combined farming experience of the farmer, farm manager and extension worker. Sadly we have
                                   no room in this process for beginner farmers or amateur ones because we can not risk the hard earned
                                   funds our clients have put into this venture.

                                    with a leading insurance company.

                                To start, we have divided the process into stages. You would be required to pay ONLY when it gets to
                                the stage of progress. For instance, You are required to first pay for the land and its clearing.
                                When that is completed, You receive a certificate authenticating what you have paid for. For every
                                stage, you would receive a certificate or document stating what you paid for and the stage it is
                                currently.
                                To pay at once, kindly send us an email. Scroll BELOW  and click PAY AT ONCE as subject.
                                We would allow the “once payment” only on specific conditions because we primarily want this site to
                                offer affordable means of farming with small easy periodic payments without putting anyone under
                                any pressure.

                              Yes, it is a new update in our process which helps us make more money and 
                              avoid wastage due to spoilages on the farm. It is the only way we can keep 
                              doing business. As we also stated, we are doing it with NO strait jacketed

                                  Absolutely. You would be allowed to visit the farm. However, you would have to book to visit the
                                  farm and it would be a maximum of 4 times. Our pre booking system allows you choose a date and
                                  we would contact you to know if the date has not clashed with someone elses own and is convenient for
                                  the farm manager. We aim to ensure your chosen date is made a reality.

                                We are working on about 40 local consumption and exportable crops.
                                <a href="#">Click HERE</a> for a full list of our current crop list.
                                Our farms are scattered around over 28 states of Nigeria.  We intend to have farms for your desired crops
                                close to you. However, some regions are best suited for the cultivation of certain crops and we would not
                                risk cultivating those crops in alien environments.

                                The reason is that we have tried to create a balance in the pricing. We discovered that some virgin
                                lands exist that are actually cheaper in some regions but to clear such virgin lands cost a lot more than
                                in other areas. In some other areas, certain local cultures exist which demand certain payments every
                                farming season.<br>
                                ALL these issues have been put into consideration in order to have a seamless process and to ensure the
                                best service. These costs are actually the lowest costs negotiated.
