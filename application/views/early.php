                     <p>We are excited in your interest in our early bird programme.</p>
                     <p>We would first like to thank you (if you are an existing customer) for walking with us on this journey also
                        for believing in our platform. If you are not, we thank you for your interest and inquiry.
                     </p>
                     <p>As we strive to give you better and improved services we also aim to provide you with access to more
                        information, updates and opportunities.
                     </p>
                     <p>One of our biggest challenges is the short opening time of our booking cycles.
                        Many complaints have been recorded relating to this. Many people would have waited for the
                        opening only for it to open and close without their knowledge.
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus,we wish to introduce The Early Bird Booking Programme.</p>
                     <p>This programme opens up our off cycle bookings such that with just N30,000.00 you can keep and lock down
                        a slot of any of the next or future openings.
                     </p>
                     <p>The early bird booking fee forms part of the actual cost of production and shall be deducted from the total
                        cost of production.
                     </p>
                     <p>It is open to both you as existing subscribers and non subscribers alike. Any one who takes this
                        opportunity will get a discounted amount. Note that the early bird program ensures that no-one
                        ever misses a booking.
                     </p>
