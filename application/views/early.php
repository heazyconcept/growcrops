                     <p>Thank you for your interest in our Regular Early Bird programme.</p>
                     <p>
                    We would first like to thank you AGAIN (if you are an existing customer) for walking with us on this journey also for believing in our platform. If you are not an existing customer, you are welcome to Nigeriaâ€™s Premium and Most innovative Farming Services Platform. Here we farm for busy people who have no time to be involved in the day to day rigors of farming but are interested in farming , processing and its possible high profit returns. We simply farm, harvest, process and sell for you. If this is your intention, you are in the right place. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         We have successfully opened and closed FIVE cycles of farming profitably. With this coming cycle, we would be pushing ALL products into processing which should allow you earn more and ensure all the prior wasted produce never goes to waste again.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     As we plan for the next cycle, One of our biggest challenges is the short opening time of our booking cycles. Many complaints have been recorded relating to this and the profit margins. Many people would also have waited for the normal opening only for it to open and close within hours without their knowledge.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>Thus,we wish to introduce The Early Bird Booking Programme.</strong></p>
                     <p>
                         This programme opens up our off cycle bookings, the booking is such that with just N30,000.00 you can keep and lock down a slot of the next booking cycle.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         You will pay N30,000 now as part of the first installment but the total cost is N197,500. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     You would also begin to receive an income approximately FOUR months after planting and after processing has taken place. Specific timelines will be communicated as these are estimates we have worked with in the past.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     Note that: The early bird booking fee forms part of the actual cost of 

                     production and shall be deducted from the total cost of production.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     It is open to both existing subscribers and newsubscribers alike. Any one who takes this opportunity will also get discount as prices are usually frozen for them. Note that the early bird program ensures that no-one ever misses a booking.
                     </p>

                     <p>Once you click on the link, you would be directed to a page that allows you pay N30,000 for Ugwu which is the only available crop at the moment.
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, depending on how many slots you would like to have, you would be required to pay N30,000 per slot.</p>
                     <p>For now, however, the information on the payment page would have only crops that are available for bookings. As such , the information above for ugwu is valid including the cost of production.
                     </p>
                     <p>You would next be required to register and then pay.</p>
                     <p>Once you pay, you will receive an email confirming your booked slot at the prevailing prices. A receipt will be sent to you and after we have sorted out land issues, we would send you a schedule which will give our timeline for both the farming and processing which is compulsory and which will allow you plan your farm visits, finances and all your subsequent transactions.</p>
                     <p>You could also call or Email : info@growcropsonline.com for more information.</p>
