                     <p>Thank you for your interest in our early bird programme.</p>
                     <p>
                     We would first like to thank you AGAIN (if you are an existing customer) for 
                     walking with us on this journey also for believing in our platform. If you are not 
                     an existing customer, you are welcome to Nigeriaâ€™s Premium and Most innovative 
                     Farming Services Platform. Here we farm for busy people who have no time to be 
                     involved in the day to day rigors of farming but are interested in farming and 
                     its possible high profit returns. If this is your intention, you are in the right 
                     place. 
                     </p>
                     <p>We have successfully opened and closed FIVE cycles of farming profitably. 
                     With this coming cycle, we would be pushing most (if not all) products into 
                     processing which would allow you earn more and ensure all the produce never 
                     goes to waste again.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     As we plan for the next cycle, One of our biggest challenges is the short 
                     opening time of our booking cycles. Many complaints have been recorded 
                     relating to this. Many people would have waited for the opening only for 
                     it to open and close without their knowledge.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>Thus,we wish to introduce The Early Bird Booking Programme.</strong></p>
                     <p>This programme opens up our off cycle bookings such that with just N30,000.00 
                     you can keep and lock down a slot of any of the next or future openings.
                     </p>
                     <p>The early bird booking fee forms part of the actual cost of production and 
                     shall be deducted from the total cost of production.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     It is open to both you as existing subscribers and new subscribers alike. 
                     Any one who takes this opportunity will get a discount as prices are usually 
                     frozen for them.
                     </p>
                     <p>Note that the early bird program ensures that no-one ever misses a booking.</p>

                     that allows you pay N30,000 for Ugwu which is the only available crop at the moment.
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, depending on how many slots you would like to have, you would be 
                     required to pay 30,000 per slot.</p>
                     <p>For now, however, the information on the payment page would have only crops 
                     that are available for bookings. As such , the information above for ugwu is 
                     valid including the cost of production.
                     </p>
                     <p>You would next be required to register and then pay</p>
                     <p>Once you pay, you will receive an email confirming your booked slot at the 
                     prevailing prices. A receipt will be sent to you and after we have sorted out 
                     land issues, we would send you a revised schedule which will give our timeline 
                     for both the farming and processing which will allow you plan your farm visits, 
                     finances and all your subsequent transactions.</p>
